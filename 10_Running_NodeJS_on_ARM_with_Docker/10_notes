Section 10. Running Node.js on ARM with Docker
==============================================

10.76 : The State of ARM and Docker for Node.js
-----------------------------------------------
- ARM runs on Docker Desktop
- ARM processors are used everywhere 
- x86 chips are everywhere, ARM is NOT compatible w/x86 
  - eg, Raspberry Pi 
- But it's hard to develop on ARM 
  - ideally need to be on the actualmachine to develop on it, eg SSH in 
- April 2019 : Docker + ARM partnership 
- Embedded Devices use ARM processors A LOT 
- Docker Desktop runs ARM now !!!
- Node is great on ARM 
- Docker is the easiest way to develop & deploy on ARM processors 


10.77 : Running Node.js ARM Containers For Development
------------------------------------------------------
- see folder ./sample-02
- Try How Easy Docker Makes Running ARM 
- DOCKER-DESKTOP ONLY 
- need images built for ARM 
- Easy button :
  - Change the FROM image to arm64v8/node:<tag>
- This forces macOS/Win to run ARM 
- Uses QEMU "processor emulation"
- Build/run like normal 
- Mix with x86 in compose 
- Docker Hub 
  - Node official image 
  - in Supported Architecture list, choose requested arch 
- modify Docker file to use Docker Hub arm64v8 tag 
- build 
- docker image inspect nm | grep Arch 
  - will see container has arm64v8 architecture



10.78 : Running Node.js ARM Containers For Production
-----------------------------------------------------
- see folder ./sample-02
- Deploying Node.js as ARM apps 
- AWS A1 Instances (Graviton Processors)
  - cheaper 
  - more RAM, better networking 
  - ARM slower than others 
- Test your IoY/Embedded code
  - sensors, drones, etc 
- Docker Hub does NOT build arm64images 
- Or does it ?  (QEMU hack)
- Build your own CI with QEMU 
- Docker Engine supported on ARM 
- Swarm just works too !!
- on AWS 
  - search for Ubuntu ARM 
  - there is a Docker CE installation documentation 


10.79 : The Future of Multi-Arch Docker : Making ARM Easier
---------------------------------------------------------
- see folder ./
- How Docker is Making ARM Easier
- Manifest files 
  - allow multiple images per different architectures 
- ARM + Docker partnership will make this easier 
- Build multi-arch in 1 command 
- Store multi-arch images in a single repo 
- Easier to know which arch you're running locally
