02 : Docker Compose Basics
==========================

Tools :
=======
node.js - mostly in a container
docker : engine & command line
docker-compose

on Mac
======
- use Docker Desktop

Why Compose ?
-------------
2 parts
- CLI & YAML files
  - CLI designed around developer workflows
- docker-compose CLI a substitute for docker CLI

- CLI - NOT DESIGNED FOR PROD environments, use ORCHESTRATION utilities


COMPOSE FILE FORMAT
===================
- multi-containers, networks, volumes, etc
  - each called a service
- written in YAML
- specific to compose
- can layer sets of YAML files, use templates, env vars

- docker-compose.yml {default name - if u want others, need to specify on cmd line}

YAML files
==========
- yaml ain't markup language
- used by Docker, K8s, Amazon & others
- easy to read
  - : -> used for key/value pairs
  - only spaces, no tabs
  - '-' used for lists


docker-compose CLI
==================
- many docker commands are same/similar in docker-compose
- IDE's now support docker-compose, eg Visual Studio, Docker-Desktop
- most default names/settings work pretty well

fyi, CLI & YAML versions differ


docker-compose up
-----------------
- 1 stop shop
- builds/pulls images if missing
- creates volumes/networks/containers/etc
- starts container{s} in foreground
  - use '-d' to detach/background
- use '--build' to always build new/latest images
  - otherwise just use up

docker-compose down
-------------------
- 1 stop shop
- stops & deletes networks/containers/etc
  - leaves data alone
- use '-v' to delete volumes

docker-compose ...
------------------
- many commands take "service" option from YAML file
- 'build' - just build/rebuild images
- 'stop' - individual containers
- 'ps' - lists "services" as well as containers, errors
- 'push' - push images up to registry - MAKE SURE TO NAME PROPERLY
- 'logs' - same as docker
- 'exec' - same as docker


2.11 - Assignment
-----------------
run thru simple commands using sample-02 from git project

cd sample-02
docker-compose up
- localhost:3000 to see app
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs
docker-compose logs web
docker-compose exec web sh
- curl localhost  {fails - missing curl}
- exit
- add RUN apk add --update curl to DockerFile
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec web sh
- curl localhost
- still fails
  - the up didn't rebuilt the image in order to install curl
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose exec web sh
- curl localhost
  - fails cuz we are using port 3000
- curl localhost:3000
- this time it works
docker-compose down
-clean up
docker-compose ps
- verify nothing running
