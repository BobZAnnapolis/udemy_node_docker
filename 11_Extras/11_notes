11.80 Bret's DockerCon Talks on Produyction DockerCon
-----------------------------------------------------
- In 2017 I gave a talk to 5+ conferences about major decisions 
you needed to make while designing your production Docker 
solution. You can watch it as "Part 1" below.

In 2018 I started giving a follow-up talk that goes through 
deploying many different apps on a single Swarm, and the 
typical setup and config this might look like for a small team 
or solo admin in Docker CE and for a big business team in 
Docker EE.

{LINK} DockerCon Part 2: Building Your Swarm Production Stack DockerCon US 2018

In Part 1 I talk about many of the decisions you need to make 
when taking your Docker containers from local dev/test to a 
production cluster. It covers decisions like:

- What host OS should I use?
- What base FROM images should I use?
- How should my Swarm node design look?
- What other tools besides Swarm do I need for production containers?
- What common issues do people have when starting a production docker project?
- How to limit the project from trying to change too much at once.
- How to speed up the project by outsourcing small pieces of solution to existing products.
- How Docker's Enterprise/Cloud products can help.

In Part 2 I cover how to deploy multiple unrelated multi-tier 
apps to Swarm (and do live demos). We cover using reverse 
proxy Traefik, including Let's Encrypt certificates, REX-Ray 
shared storage for persistent data, Prometheus monitoring, 
ELK logging, and more. All with demos and a GitHub repo full 
of samples.
